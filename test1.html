		<h1>The Future of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
		<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved dramatically over the past decade, transforming from a niche
			research field into a powerful technology that influences nearly every aspect of our daily lives. From
			virtual assistants that recognize our voices to recommendation systems that predict our preferences, AI
			technologies have become ubiquitous in modern society.</p>
		<p>Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in deep learning and neural networks, have catapulted AI
			capabilities to new heights. These technologies now power everything from autonomous vehicles to medical
			diagnosis tools, demonstrating remarkable accuracy and efficiency in tasks that once required human
			expertise.</p>
		<h2>Transformative Applications</h2>
		<p>The healthcare industry stands to benefit enormously from AI integration. Machine learning algorithms can
			analyze medical images to detect early signs of disease, potentially saving countless lives through early
			intervention. AI-powered research tools are accelerating drug discovery by predicting molecular interactions
			and identifying promising compounds in a fraction of the time traditional methods require.</p>
		<p>In education, personalized learning platforms are using AI to adapt to individual student needs, providing
			customized educational experiences that address specific strengths and weaknesses. This approach shows
			promise in improving educational outcomes across diverse student populations.</p>
		<blockquote> "The question isn't whether AI will transform education, but how we will shape that transformation
			to benefit all learners." - Dr. Eliza Montgomery, Education Futurist </blockquote>
		<p>The transportation sector is witnessing a revolution through autonomous driving technologies. Self-driving
			vehicles promise to reduce accidents, decrease traffic congestion, and provide mobility options for those
			unable to drive. While fully autonomous vehicles are still evolving, driver-assistance features powered by
			AI are already improving road safety.</p>

		<h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
		<p>As AI systems grow more sophisticated and gain influence over critical decisions, ethical considerations
			become increasingly important. Questions about privacy, bias, accountability, and transparency demand
			careful attention from researchers, developers, and policymakers alike.</p>
		<p>AI systems learn from data, and that data often reflects historical biases present in society. Without
			careful design and oversight, these systems can perpetuate or even amplify existing inequalities. Developing
			fair and unbiased AI requires diverse development teams and rigorous testing methodologies.</p>
		<p>Privacy concerns also loom large as AI systems collect and analyze vast amounts of personal data. Striking
			the right balance between data utilization and privacy protection remains a significant challenge for the
			industry.</p>
		<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
		<p>A sprinter starts running on a circular path of radius r metres. Her average speed (in metres/minute) is
			$$\pi$$ r during the first 30 seconds, $$\pi$$ r/2 during next one minute, $$\pi$$ r/4 during next 2
			minutes, $$\pi$$ r/8 during next 4 minutes, and so on. What is the ratio of the time taken for the nth round
			to that for the previous round? The coming decade will likely see even more transformative developments in
			AI. Quantum computing promises to dramatically increase computational power, potentially enabling AI systems
			to tackle problems currently beyond reach. Neuromorphic computing, which mimics the structure and function
			of the human brain, may lead to more efficient and capable AI architectures.</p>
		<p>As these technologies advance, the relationship between humans and AI will continue to evolve. Rather than
			replacing human workers entirely, the most successful implementations will likely augment human
			capabilities, handling routine tasks while allowing people to focus on creative, empathetic, and strategic
			activities that remain uniquely human.</p>
		<p>The future of AI is not predetermined. Through thoughtful development, appropriate regulation, and inclusive
			dialogue, we can shape these powerful technologies to benefit humanity while mitigating potential risks.</p>

					<p><br>According to given conditions angle between AC and AB is 30 degrees and between AB and BC is 60 degrees. So the triangle formed is a 30-60-90 triangle.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Hence,&nbsp;$$\angle\ ABC=60^{\circ\ }$$,&nbsp;$$\angle\ CAB=30^{\circ\ }$$, which implies&nbsp;$$\angle\ ACB=180^{\circ\ }-\left(30^{\circ\ }+60^{\circ\ }\right)=90^{\circ\ }$$</p>
					<p>Therefore, The triangle is a right-angled triangle with base = BC, height = AC, and hypotenuse = AB.</p>
					<p>We know that&nbsp;$$\cos\ \angle\ ABC\ =\ \frac{\ BC}{AB}=&gt;\ \cos60^{\circ\ }=\frac{BC}{500}\ =&gt;\ 500\times\ \frac{1}{2}=250\ km$$</p>
					<p>Similarly, $$\sin\ \angle\ ABC\ =\ \frac{\ AC}{AB}=&gt;\ \sin60^{\circ\ }=\frac{AC}{500}\ =&gt;\ 500\times\ \frac{\sqrt{\ 3}}{2}=250\sqrt{\ 3}\ km$$</p>
					<p>So, total time taken by train to travel B to&nbsp;C is&nbsp;is (250/50) = 5 hrs, hence the train reaches at 1 pm. Accordingly, Rahim has to reach C fifteen minutes before i.e. at 12:45 PM.</p>
					<p>Time taken by Rahim to travel by&nbsp;car is around&nbsp;$$\ \frac{\ 250\sqrt{\ 3}}{70}=6.19$$ hrs (Around 6.2 hrs = 6 hrs 12 minutes). So, the latest time by which Rahim must leave A and still be able to catch the train is 6:30 am.</p>
