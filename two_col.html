            Sample 1: 'Corruption in India' (267 words)

            "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
            It is not easy to define corruption. But in a narrow sense, corruption is mostly concerned with "bribery"
            and it takes several forms. Corruption today is a world-wide phenomenon and India is one of the most corrupt
            nations in the world.

            Corruption is an indication of decadence. A corrupt person is termed immoral and dishonest. Only a person
            with greatly eroded values indulges in corruption.

            The problem with corruption is that it threatens the very existence of the society . Corruption is like a
            leech draining the blood of the society. The worst part is that it affects every part of human life: the
            flourishing black market in essential commodities, adulteration of even food, bribe, fraud and economic,
            political and administrative manipulations etc have made the people feel greatly miserable and helpless.

            We can trace corruption to ancient times. Kautilya, the author of the Arthasastra pointed out corruption of
            his times. He also talked about the inevitability of corruption. He had said, "Just as it is impossible not
            to taste the honey or the poison that finds itself at the tip of the tongue, so it is impossible for a
            government servant not to eat up at least a bit of the king's revenue. These in the postwar world became
            only bolder while eating up government money and accepting bribes.

            Today, although India is free, the government officials have enslaved the general public with their
            corruption. Most of them are hand in gloves with businessmen and thus the whole system is corrupt. What
            starts at the top percolates down to the lowest rungs of the society. It has thus become widespread even in
            villages.

            The situation is so bad that it looks like India will never get rid of corruption.

            Sample 2: 'Secular State' (261 words)

            We all know that India is a secular State, and that a secular state has nothing to do with religion; but,
            what exactly does this mean. Secularism, if properly implemented, can control extremism, religious bigotry
            and other negative forces.

            As said above, a secular state does not recognize any religion, which means a secular State, in essence,
            should not discriminate against any a citizen belonging to any religion.

            Earlier things were different; even a hundred years ago in India, people were discriminated against based on
            religion, faith, caste, etc. There were many such undemocratic, non-secular things in existence. This led to
            the persecution of people. The harrassed would leave their homeland, their country and suffer a lot. This
            was also true of the world in general. Parsis, for instance, came to India from Iran.

            Now, thankfully, that is a thing of the past. Due to great thinkers, philosophers and scholars, things have
            changed. Politics and the government are being kept away from religion. These days almost all the civilized
            countries are secular.

            That does not mean religions are banned. Everyone has a right to follow whatever faith he or she wants. The
            only thing is that, the government is neutral in this regard. This is because, if religious ceremonies are
            encouraged openly, the government will come to be identified with a particular religion.India is a good
            example in this regard. Though Hindus form a large majority, no Hindu festival is State sponsored.

            Secularism in the State has, thus, extreme importance. A society tends to be equal, homogeneous and peaceful
            with secularism.

            Sample 3: How to control population explosion in India? (263 words)

            As we all know, we Indians have the dubious distinction of being the second most populated country in the
            world. And, very soon we will be ranked number one in terms of population. Well, that's not a cause for
            celebration!

            A large population is a liability and not an asset. In our country, population explosion is the main
            obstacle to the development in all aspects. Since this problem is getting severe by the day, it is better to
            take appropriate measures to keep it under control before it is too late.

            Unlike what most people think, population is not an advantage in any manner. Demographic history of various
            advanced countries shows that there is an inverse relationship between a country's overall happiness and the
            countryÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s birth rate. When per-capita income increases, people donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t desire more children in
            order to supplement their income. In other words, with increase in per-capita income, people feel more
            secure and do not want to depend on their children. Therefore, rapid economic development is very much
            essential to control the already high birth rate. However, this increase in per-capita income will have its
            positive impact on birth rate after a period of time.

            In the Indian society we have joint family system. In joint families, in general a high birth rate is
            encouraged. Hence this joint family has to be replaced by nucleur family. A nucleur family is generally
            found in an urbanized and industrialized economies. Hence our efforts should be to industrialize and
            urbanize our economy to reduce the high birth rate and thereby control the population growth.

            Sample 4: 'Science in everyday life'

            Science is a part of our everyday life. In its broadest meaning science means 'knowledge'. And, as
            knowledge, it had entered life of even the most primitive human beings. They knew, in protein and
            carbohydrate and containing vitamins. The result is a healthy prolonged life. One can imagine how life must
            have been in pre-scientific days. Science has also improved clothing and made it more appropriate for
            climatic and working conditions. Man-made fibers and versatile spinning machines, today enable us to dress
            in clothes both comfortable and smart without being expensive.

            We can't think of our everyday life without science. For instance, the safe from the poisonous berry. They
            knew some rudimentary ideas about building a hut, sharpening a spear, and fishing in the river. This is what
            is science which distinguishes man from the animals which rely on their instinct.

            Yet, for most people 'science' means a number of abstract subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology and
            mechanics, to quote a few, which have to be learnt as part of 'education', yet which seem to have little
            bearing on everyday living. This is all wrong. Our way of life is completely dependent on science and its
            inventions and discoveries surround us on all sides.

            Since the Renaissance science has b in protein and carbohydrate and containing vitamins. The result is a
            healthy prolonged life. One can imagine how life must have been in pre-scientific days. Science has also
            improved clothing and made it more appropriate for climatic and working conditions. Man-mo the present.

            Today, we have many consumer goods from the simple frying-pan to the and aeroplane, from the alarm-clock to
            the laptop. All these things serve to make life easier and more pleasant. Science gives us safe food, free
            of harmful germs, in hygienic tins. The result is a healthy prolonged life. One can imagine how life must
            have been in pre-scientific days. Science has also improved clothing and made it more appropriate for
            climatic and working conditions.

            We can't think of our everyday life without science.

            Sample 5: ' The world of entertainment'

            Entertainment, something that provides amusement or enjoyment, is one of the basic needs of humans. Man has
            needed and indulged in entertainment. Greek tragedy and comedy, Indian epic dramas, were an important
            feature of ancient soceity, staged in impressive open-air theaters. Puppet shows of the East, even today,
            can draw crowds of village spectators. Singing and dancing have been there since ages. This is how it has
            been, and will always be in all the parts of the world.

            'Entertainment' implies non-participation by the audience. A cricket match may be entertainment to the
            spectators, but it is sport to the players. To be 'entertained', we must be content to look, and to
            listen.dern entertainment is highly a organized business and has great variety. Especially in a big city
            every conceivable form of entertainment can be had, the greatest of all being cinema and music, especially
            to young people! There is a glamour and glitter about it all which makes it irresistible. The prominent
            'stars', especially, the 'pop' stars, of today become the idols of the adolescents. The stars from Hollywood
            and Bollywood can be taken as examples.
            Beneath the glitter and the glamour, however, lies hardship and dissappointment for the majority. The
            promoters, the managers and the impresarios are never poor men, and the entertainer becomes pathetically
            dependent on them -- especially when his public image is fading. But despite all this, we still have the
            professionals and always shall have entertainment. Because the world of entertainment has an eternal,
            irresistible glamour. 'The show must go on !' That's the world of entertainment


            Modern entertainment is highly a organized business and has great variety. Especially in a big city every

            Sample 6: ' Gateway to Prestigious Careers: The Role of Indian Government Competitive Exams'

            Indian government competitive exams are an important part of the country's public sector recruitment
            process. These tests, including the UPSC Civil Services, SSC CGL, and various state-level exams, lead to
            prominent government employment. They evaluate candidates on a variety of criteria, including general
            knowledge, aptitude, and specific area expertise. The rigorous selection procedure ensures that only the
            most qualified people are picked to serve the public. These tests are extremely competitive, garnering
            millions of candidates each year, demonstrating hopefuls' dedication to obtaining stable, respected
            government jobs that contribute to India's government and growth.
