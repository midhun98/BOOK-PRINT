            Sample 1: 'Corruption in India' (267 words)

            "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
            It is not easy to define corruption. But in a narrow sense, corruption is mostly concerned with "bribery"
            and it takes several forms. Corruption today is a world-wide phenomenon and India is one of the most corrupt
            nations in the world.

            Corruption is an indication of decadence. A corrupt person is termed immoral and dishonest. Only a person
            with greatly eroded values indulges in corruption.

            The problem with corruption is that it threatens the very existence of the society . Corruption is like a
            leech draining the blood of the society. The worst part is that it affects every part of human life: the
            flourishing black market in essential commodities, adulteration of even food, bribe, fraud and economic,
            political and administrative manipulations etc have made the people feel greatly miserable and helpless.

            We can trace corruption to ancient times. Kautilya, the author of the Arthasastra pointed out corruption of
            his times. He also talked about the inevitability of corruption. He had said, "Just as it is impossible not
            to taste the honey or the poison that finds itself at the tip of the tongue, so it is impossible for a
            government servant not to eat up at least a bit of the king's revenue. These in the postwar world became
            only bolder while eating up government money and accepting bribes.

            Today, although India is free, the government officials have enslaved the general public with their
            corruption. Most of them are hand in gloves with businessmen and thus the whole system is corrupt. What
            starts at the top percolates down to the lowest rungs of the society. It has thus become widespread even in
            villages.

            The situation is so bad that it looks like India will never get rid of corruption.

            Sample 2: 'Secular State' (261 words)

            We all know that India is a secular State, and that a secular state has nothing to do with religion; but,
            what exactly does this mean. Secularism, if properly implemented, can control extremism, religious bigotry
            and other negative forces.

            As said above, a secular state does not recognize any religion, which means a secular State, in essence,
            should not discriminate against any a citizen belonging to any religion.

            Earlier things were different; even a hundred years ago in India, people were discriminated against based on
            religion, faith, caste, etc. There were many such undemocratic, non-secular things in existence. This led to
            the persecution of people. The harrassed would leave their homeland, their country and suffer a lot. This
            was also true of the world in general. Parsis, for instance, came to India from Iran.

            Now, thankfully, that is a thing of the past. Due to great thinkers, philosophers and scholars, things have
            changed. Politics and the government are being kept away from religion. These days almost all the civilized
            countries are secular.

            That does not mean religions are banned. Everyone has a right to follow whatever faith he or she wants. The
            only thing is that, the government is neutral in this regard. This is because, if religious ceremonies are
            encouraged openly, the government will come to be identified with a particular religion.India is a good
            example in this regard. Though Hindus form a large majority, no Hindu festival is State sponsored.

            Secularism in the State has, thus, extreme importance. A society tends to be equal, homogeneous and peaceful
            with secularism.

            Sample 3: How to control population explosion in India? (263 words)

            As we all know, we Indians have the dubious distinction of being the second most populated country in the
            world. And, very soon we will be ranked number one in terms of population. Well, that's not a cause for
            celebration!

            A large population is a liability and not an asset. In our country, population explosion is the main
            obstacle to the development in all aspects. Since this problem is getting severe by the day, it is better to
            take appropriate measures to keep it under control before it is too late.

            Unlike what most people think, population is not an advantage in any manner. Demographic history of various
            advanced countries shows that there is an inverse relationship between a country's overall happiness and the
            countryÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s birth rate. When per-capita income increases, people donÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t desire more children in
            order to supplement their income. In other words, with increase in per-capita income, people feel more
            secure and do not want to depend on their children. Therefore, rapid economic development is very much
            essential to control the already high birth rate. However, this increase in per-capita income will have its
            positive impact on birth rate after a period of time.

            In the Indian society we have joint family system. In joint families, in general a high birth rate is
            encouraged. Hence this joint family has to be replaced by nucleur family. A nucleur family is generally
            found in an urbanized and industrialized economies. Hence our efforts should be to industrialize and
            urbanize our economy to reduce the high birth rate and thereby control the population growth.

            Sample 4: 'Science in everyday life'

            Science is a part of our everyday life. In its broadest meaning science means 'knowledge'. And, as
            knowledge, it had entered life of even the most primitive human beings. They knew, in protein and
            carbohydrate and containing vitamins. The result is a healthy prolonged life. One can imagine how life must
            have been in pre-scientific days. Science has also improved clothing and made it more appropriate for
            climatic and working conditions. Man-made fibers and versatile spinning machines, today enable us to dress
            in clothes both comfortable and smart without being expensive.

            We can't think of our everyday life without science. For instance, the safe from the poisonous berry. They
            knew some rudimentary ideas about building a hut, sharpening a spear, and fishing in the river. This is what
            is science which distinguishes man from the animals which rely on their instinct.

            Yet, for most people 'science' means a number of abstract subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology and
            mechanics, to quote a few, which have to be learnt as part of 'education', yet which seem to have little
            bearing on everyday living. This is all wrong. Our way of life is completely dependent on science and its
            inventions and discoveries surround us on all sides.

            Since the Renaissance science has b in protein and carbohydrate and containing vitamins. The result is a
            healthy prolonged life. One can imagine how life must have been in pre-scientific days. Science has also
            improved clothing and made it more appropriate for climatic and working conditions. Man-mo the present.

            Today, we have many consumer goods from the simple frying-pan to the and aeroplane, from the alarm-clock to
            the laptop. All these things serve to make life easier and more pleasant. Science gives us safe food, free
            of harmful germs, in hygienic tins. The result is a healthy prolonged life. One can imagine how life must
            have been in pre-scientific days. Science has also improved clothing and made it more appropriate for
            climatic and working conditions.

            We can't think of our everyday life without science.

            Sample 5: ' The world of entertainment'

            Entertainment, something that provides amusement or enjoyment, is one of the basic needs of humans. Man has
            needed and indulged in entertainment. Greek tragedy and comedy, Indian epic dramas, were an important
            feature of ancient soceity, staged in impressive open-air theaters. Puppet shows of the East, even today,
            can draw crowds of village spectators. Singing and dancing have been there since ages. This is how it has
            been, and will always be in all the parts of the world.

            'Entertainment' implies non-participation by the audience. A cricket match may be entertainment to the
            spectators, but it is sport to the players. To be 'entertained', we must be content to look, and to
            listen.dern entertainment is highly a organized business and has great variety. Especially in a big city
            every conceivable form of entertainment can be had, the greatest of all being cinema and music, especially
            to young people! There is a glamour and glitter about it all which makes it irresistible. The prominent
            'stars', especially, the 'pop' stars, of today become the idols of the adolescents. The stars from Hollywood
            and Bollywood can be taken as examples.
            Beneath the glitter and the glamour, however, lies hardship and dissappointment for the majority. The
            promoters, the managers and the impresarios are never poor men, and the entertainer becomes pathetically
            dependent on them -- especially when his public image is fading. But despite all this, we still have the
            professionals and always shall have entertainment. Because the world of entertainment has an eternal,
            irresistible glamour. 'The show must go on !' That's the world of entertainment

            Sample 6: ' Gateway to Prestigious Careers: The Role of Indian Government Competitive Exams'

            Indian government competitive exams are an important part of the country's public sector recruitment
            process. These tests, including the UPSC Civil Services, SSC CGL, and various state-level exams, lead to
            prominent government employment. They evaluate candidates on a variety of criteria, including general
            knowledge, aptitude, and specific area expertise. The rigorous selection procedure ensures that only the
            most qualified people are picked to serve the public. These tests are extremely competitive, garnering
            millions of candidates each year, demonstrating hopefuls' dedication to obtaining stable, respected
            government jobs that contribute to India's government and growth.

            We asked dozens of experts on essay writing and test scores for their take on what makes a great college
            essay. Check out five of our favorite college essay tips below.

            1. Imagine how the person reading your essay will feel.

            No one's idea of a good time is writing a college essay, I know. But if sitting down to write your essay
            feels like a chore, and you're bored by what you're saying, you can imagine how the person reading your
            essay will feel. On the other hand, if you're writing about something you love, something that excites you,
            something that you've thought deeply about, chances are I'm going to set down your application feeling
            excited, too—and feeling like I've gotten to know you.

            graduate.

            2. Write like a journalist.

            "Don't bury the lede!" The first few sentences must capture the reader's attention, provide a gist of the
            story, and give a sense of where the essay is heading. Think about any article you've read—how do you decide
            to read it? You read the first few sentences and then decide. The same goes for college essays. A strong
            lede (journalist parlance for "lead") will place your reader in the "accept" mindset from the beginning of
            the essay. A weak lede will have your reader thinking "reject"—a mindset from which it's nearly impossible
            to recover.

            This college essay tip is by Brad Schiller, MIT graduate and CEO of Prompt, which provides individualized
            feedback on thousands of students’ essays each year.

            3. Don't read the Common Application prompts.

            If you already have, erase them from memory and write the story you want colleges to hear. The truth is,
            admission reviewers rarely know—or care—which prompt you are responding to. They are curious to discover
            what you choose to show them about who you are, what you value, and why. Even the most fluid writers are
            often stifled by fitting their narrative neatly into a category and the essay quickly loses authentic voice.
            Write freely and choose a prompt later. Spoiler alert...one prompt is "Share an essay on any topic of your
            choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own
            design. " So have at it.

            Manchester, N.H. and contributor to the NYT, HuffPost, and Forbes on intentionally approaching college
            admissions.

            4. Show your emotions.

            Adding feelings to your essays can be much more powerful than just listing your achievements. It allows
            reviewers to connect with you and understand your personality and what drives you. In particular, be open to
            showing vulnerability. Nobody expects you to be perfect and acknowledging times in which you have felt
            nervous or scared shows maturity and self-awareness.

            This college essay tip is by Charles Maynard, Oxford and Stanford University Graduate and founder of Going
            Merry, which is a one-stop shop for applying to college scholarships

            5. Revise often and early.

            Your admissions essay should go through several stages of revision. And by revisions, we don’t mean quick
            proofreads. Ask your parents, teachers, high school counselors or friends for their eyes and edits. It
            should be people who know you best and want you to succeed. Take their constructive criticism in the spirit
            for which they intend—your benefit.

            Personal Statement Examples
            The "Burying Grandma" Example College Essay
            Written for the Common App college application essays "Tell us your story" prompt. This essay could work for
            prompts 1 and 7 for the Common App.

            They covered the precious mahogany coffin with a brown amalgam of rocks, decomposed organisms, and weeds. It
            was my turn to take the shovel, but I felt too ashamed to dutifully send her off when I had not properly
            said goodbye. I refused to throw dirt on her. I refused to let go of my grandmother, to accept a death I had
            not seen coming, to believe that an illness could not only interrupt, but steal a beloved life.

            When my parents finally revealed to me that my grandmother had been battling liver cancer, I was twelve and
            I was angry--mostly with myself. They had wanted to protect me--only six years old at the time--from the
            complex and morose concept of death. However, when the end inevitably arrived, I wasn’t trying to comprehend
            what dying was; I was trying to understand how I had been able to abandon my sick grandmother in favor of
            playing with friends and watching TV. Hurt that my parents had deceived me and resentful of my own oblivion,
            I committed myself to preventing such blindness from resurfacing.

            I became desperately devoted to my education because I saw knowledge as the key to freeing myself from the
            chains of ignorance. While learning about cancer in school I promised myself that I would memorize every
            fact and absorb every detail in textbooks and online medical journals. And as I began to consider my future,
            I realized that what I learned in school would allow me to silence that which had silenced my grandmother.
            However, I was focused not with learning itself, but with good grades and high test scores. I started to
            believe that academic perfection would be the only way to redeem myself in her eyes--to make up for what I
            had not done as a granddaughter.

            However, a simple walk on a hiking trail behind my house made me open my own eyes to the truth. Over the
            years, everything--even honoring my grandmother--had become second to school and grades. As my shoes humbly
            tapped against the Earth, the towering trees blackened by the forest fire a few years ago, the faintly
            colorful pebbles embedded in the sidewalk, and the wispy white clouds hanging in the sky reminded me of my
            small though nonetheless significant part in a larger whole that is humankind and this Earth. Before I could
            resolve my guilt, I had to broaden my perspective of the world as well as my responsibilities to my fellow
            humans.

            Volunteering at a cancer treatment center has helped me discover my path. When I see patients trapped in not
            only the hospital but also a moment in time by their diseases, I talk to them. For six hours a day, three
            times a week, Ivana is surrounded by IV stands, empty walls, and busy nurses that quietly yet constantly
            remind her of her breast cancer. Her face is pale and tired, yet kind--not unlike my grandmother’s. I need
            only to smile and say hello to see her brighten up as life returns to her face. Upon our first meeting, she
            opened up about her two sons, her hometown, and her knitting group--no mention of her disease. Without even
            standing up, the three of us—Ivana, me, and my grandmother--had taken a walk together.

            Cancer, as powerful and invincible as it may seem, is a mere fraction of a person’s life. It’s easy to
            forget when one’s mind and body are so weak and vulnerable. I want to be there as an oncologist to remind
            them to take a walk once in a while, to remember that there’s so much more to life than a disease. While I
            physically treat their cancer, I want to lend patients emotional support and mental strength to escape the
            interruption and continue living. Through my work, I can accept the shovel without burying my grandmother’s
            memory.

            Tips + Analysis:

            Make (Narrative) structure work for you. This essay uses what we call Narrative Structure, which focuses (in
            roughly equal word count) on a challenge + effects you’ve faced, what you did about it, and what you
            learned. Quick tip: one common and easy mistake is to spend most of the essay focused on the challenges +
            effects, but try to keep that to about a third—what your reader is generally more interested in is what you
            did about that challenge and what you learned/how you’ve grown. For a more complete guide to using Narrative
            Structure to shape your personal statement, check out that link.
